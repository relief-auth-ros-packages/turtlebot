Have you ever wanted to know the trajectory of a robot with respect to the
map based solely on its odometric readings but you also at the same time need
to use a localisation method? Is your initial pose being kind-of off so you
first need to move the robot so that its pose estimate has converged but
doing so dislocates the `base_footprint` frame from `odom`, thereby destroying
the desired odometry?

Worry no more: this package does exactly what you need. You `bringup` your
robot, and `base_footprint` coincides with `odom`. Your initial pose estimate
is off and therefore you move the robot slightly to the left and to the right
and forward and backward, and in the process, since the localisation method
that you use all the time accounts for odom drift, and motion has happened,
the two frames no longer coincide. Once initialisation has happened, you know
want to know `odom` from here on out with respect to `map` (or the robot's
initial reliable pose as a reference frame). You issue

```
roslaunch odom_logger avanti_odom_logger.launch
```

and then set the new odom frame to where the robot is by issuing

```
rosservice call /odom_logger/set_initial_pose
```

When you are indeed ready to log odometry you issue

```
rosservice call /odom_logger/start
```

Have a nice day.
